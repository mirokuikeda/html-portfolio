<h1>The Best Movies According to Sohom</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Castle in the Sky</h3>
<p>
  I love adventure movies and this was one of the first ones I watched. It's a
  Studio Ghibli production. All Studio Ghibli productions by default are my
  favorites.
</p>

<h3>Princess Mononoke</h3>
<p>
  Being pro environment and pro earth, I absolutely adore environment-themed
  movies. And this one has an emotional story to tell.
</p>

<h3>Nausica Valley of the Wind</h3>
<p>
  Another Studio Ghibli masterpiece. Another environment-themed movie. This time
  dealing with a post-apocalyptic dystopia. Amazing watch.
